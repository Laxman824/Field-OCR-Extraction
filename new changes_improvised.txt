Field extraction additional changes 


2. on multiple docs at a time it should work
3. novelty
4. accept all input formats  tiff, png, jpg, pdf etc..
5. fields shouldn't be hardcode, while the fields should be displayed from image  extracted text and then user should be able to select any of those.
for example now we are selecting  few fields which are Mobile number,PAN ,Folio Number,Email,Address etc. from the scanned images i want it to updatesuch that the extracted fields or text from image has to be 
showed for a user to select 
6.to improve the text extracted is good enough by not relying on the ocr
Once text has been extracted from images using OCR or machine learning models, you might want to pre-process the text with natural language algorithms in order to correct formatting or information loss issues which might have occurred during the conversion. Moreover, you can leverage NLP to do additional processing on top of the text for example to do a sentiment analysis


7.improving user experience 

Document parsing libraries are also a good option for extracting text from images contained within documents like pdf. Document parsing libraries can also implement OCR and machine learning in order to extract text from images contained within a document.

8.After the extraction is complete, review the extracted text.provides a user-friendly interface for this purpose. Edit or correct any inaccuracies if needed.

9.consider the key value pairs such as FAX PHONE NUMBER: (212) 545-3299 website document ai google 
rather than considering only one bounding box
we should be able to hover around the extracted text such as when i hover around around phone number it should map it to extracted phone number and show on it
